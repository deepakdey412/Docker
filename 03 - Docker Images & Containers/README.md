## **1️⃣ What is a Docker Image?** 🖼️

Think of a **Docker image** as a **blueprint or template**. 🏗️

* It is a **read-only file** that has everything needed to run an application:

  * 📦 The app code
  * ⚙️ Dependencies (like Python, Java, libraries)
  * 🛠️ System tools and settings

* **Important:** You **cannot run an image directly**. It’s just a template. ❌

**Analogy:**
Imagine you want to bake a cake 🎂:

* The **recipe** is like a Docker **image** — it tells you how to make the cake.
* You can use this recipe to bake **many cakes** 🍰🍰.

## **2️⃣ What is a Docker Container?** 🐳

A **Docker container** is a **running instance of a Docker image**. ⚡

* It is **isolated**, meaning it has its own file system, CPU, memory, and network 🖥️.
* You **can start, stop, and delete** a container without affecting the image. 🔄
* Containers are **lightweight and fast** compared to virtual machines 🚀.

**Analogy:**
Using the same cake example 🎂:

* The **cake you bake from the recipe** is like a Docker **container**.
* You can bake **multiple cakes** from the same recipe 🍰🍰.

## **3️⃣ How Image and Container Are Related** 🔗

* **Image → Container:** A container is created from an image 🏭➡️⚡
* **Image = Blueprint** (read-only), **Container = Running App** (live environment) 💡
* You can have **one image** and run **many containers** from it 🔄

---

## **4️⃣ Practical Example** 🧪

Let’s take a real example using Docker **Hello World** 👋:

### **Step 1: Pull an Image** ⬇️

```bash
docker pull hello-world
```

* This downloads the **hello-world image** from Docker Hub 🌐.
* You can see the image by running:

```bash
docker images
```

### **Step 2: Run a Container** ▶️

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

* Docker creates a **container from the image** and runs it 🏃‍♂️.
* You’ll see a message: `"Hello from Docker!"` ✅
* This proves your container is running successfully 🎉.

### **Step 3: Check Running Containers** 🔍

```bash
docker ps
```

* Shows all **running containers**.
* To see stopped containers:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

### **Step 4: Stop/Delete a Container** ✋🗑️

```bash
docker stop <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
```

---

## **5️⃣ Another Example: Running a Web App** 🌐

Suppose you have a simple **Node.js app** ⚡:

**Step 1: Create Dockerfile (Image blueprint)** 📄

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js official image
FROM node:18

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy app code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the app
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

**Step 2: Build Image** 🏗️

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
```

**Step 3: Run Container** ▶️🐳

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-node-app
```

* Now your app is running in a **container** ⚡
* You can access it on `http://localhost:3000` 🌐

### ✅ **Key Takeaways** 🎯

* 🖼️ **Image** = Blueprint (read-only)
* 🐳 **Container** = Running instance (live)
* 1️⃣ Image → multiple containers
* ⚡ Containers are isolated, lightweight, and easy to manage
* 🛠️ Use **Dockerfile** to create your own images
